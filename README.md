# README #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###

* Quick summary

  This project has been done by students of FCIS Ain Shams university 
  The project is an implementation of AES and DES encryption / decryption algorithms, when you run the project choose open an image choose your preferred encryption algorithm, 
  enter your message, encrypt it and finally hide it in the image.
 
* 1.0

### How do I get set up? ###

* Summary of set up
  
* Configuration
   It's just simple, copy it into your local repository, open .sln file using Visual studio 2012 or higher version 
* Dependencies:

  -Matlab Compiler Runtime (MCR). If you already have matlab installed on your machine, you will find it 
   @PATH: MATLAB Directory\toolbox\compiler\deploy\win32 (or win64)\MCRInstaller.exe,
   or you can download it from [here](http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/?refresh=true) if you don't have matlab
  -You will also need to add MWArray.dll to your references (PATH: MATLAB Directory\toolbox\dotnetbuilder\bin\win32\v2.0), or will find it in (Required DLLs) folder
  -And the most important final step is, that you need to add the core dll of AES Matlab implementation, (SteganographyMatlab.dll) located in (Required DLLs) folder



### Who do I talk to? ###

* Ibrahim Amer: ibrahim.ali.amer92@gmail.com

### To Review Matlab Code ###
Will find a folder called AES Matlab (only AES algorithm were implemented in Matlab)
